### Copy of Rare Games Website 

## Task 

Your challenge is to clone a website as closely as possible. Don't worry about how it functions, all I require is that it looks as identical as possible. 

## Summary of project. I built this website clone as part of the CodeNation Software Developer bootcamp in 2023. 

## Score: 83.33/100

## Project Feedback:

Great work, Jett.

The Rare website looks great and is quite similar to the real website.

I like your consistent use of semantic HTML throughout - this is very helpful to you, me, any other developers reading your code, browsers, and screen readers!

You made appropriate use of flexbox to create the layout of each section from the navbar, image and text side by side and the footer. You haven’t used comments in your HTML but the layout is quite straightforward and perhaps not needed for this assignment – but be prepared to add them if code gets more complex.

Your webpage does not adjust to different screen sizes and could do with having consideration to this and be responsive – especially in this modern era where people view content on many different devices. I’m sure that given more time, you would have included this into your work.

It would be a good idea to organise your web images into a separate ‘image’ folder so that the ‘main’ project folder is kept clean and not cluttered. We will look more into this organisation in our JavaScript Week 2 work J

Thank you for including the GitHub link and the live version link in the assignment submission. This really helps me to see your code and site easily.

Overall good job which fulfils the assignment brief.
